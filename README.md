I am designing a sport specific mental health app that will allow individuals in the sports community such as current athletes, former athletes, coaches, trainers etc. access to an easy sport specific mental health self-evaluation using the MHC-SF (Mental Health Continuum â€“ Short Form) method. The app will be a place to learn about mental health with supportive resources, tips and advice.
